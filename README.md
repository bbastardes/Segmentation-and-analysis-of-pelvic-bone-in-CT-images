# Segmentation and analysis of pelvic bone in CT images

In this project, a tool to perform atlas-based segmentation is proposed, allowing 3D segmentation of 4 different regions from CT images: Right femur, left femur, right hip bone and left hip bone. Additionally, a classifier to localize the left obturator foramen in sagital slices was implemented. It gives the most likely slice containing such anatomical part of interest.
